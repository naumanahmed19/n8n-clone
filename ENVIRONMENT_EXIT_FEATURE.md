```

### Behavior

**When to Show:**

- Only visible when an environment is currently selected
- Hidden when no environment is selected (main workflow view)

**What it Does:**

1. Clears the selected environment
2. Reloads the page to restore the main workflow
3. User returns to editing the main workflow

## User Flow

### Viewing and Exiting an Environment

**Step 1: View Environment**

```
Click Environment Dropdown
  ‚Üì
Select "Development"
  ‚Üì
Development workflow loads automatically
  ‚Üì
Selector shows "üîß Development v1.2.0"
```

**Step 2: Exit Environment View**

```
Click Environment Dropdown
  ‚Üì
Click "‚úï Exit Environment View"
  ‚Üì
Page reloads
  ‚Üì
Main workflow restored
  ‚Üì
Selector shows "Select Environment"
```

## Technical Implementation

### EnvironmentSelector.tsx

**Added Handler:**

```typescript
const handleExitEnvironmentView = () => {
  // Clear the selected environment
  selectEnvironment(null);

  // Reload the page to restore the main workflow
  if (workflowId) {
    window.location.reload();
  }
};
```

**Added UI Option:**

```tsx
{
  currentEnvironment && (
    <>
      <DropdownMenuItem onClick={handleExitEnvironmentView}>
        <X className="w-4 h-4" />
        <span>Exit Environment View</span>
      </DropdownMenuItem>
      <DropdownMenuSeparator />
    </>
  );
}
```

**Added Icon Import:**

```typescript
import { ..., X } from 'lucide-react'
```

## Benefits

### ‚úÖ Contextual

- Only appears when needed (viewing an environment)
- Doesn't clutter the UI when not applicable

### ‚úÖ Clear Action

- Uses X icon (universal "close/exit" symbol)
- Clear label: "Exit Environment View"
- Positioned at top for easy access

### ‚úÖ Consistent Location

- Always in the same place (environment dropdown)
- Users know where to find it
- Follows principle of grouping related actions

### ‚úÖ Safe

- Page reload ensures clean state
- No risk of mixed workflow data
- Predictable behavior

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### ‚ùå Separate Exit Button in Toolbar

**Why not**:

- Adds visual clutter
- Creates redundant UI element
- Less intuitive (why is exit in toolbar?)

### ‚ùå Exit Badge Next to Selector

**Why not**:

- Redundant with selector showing current environment
- Takes up toolbar space
- Not as discoverable

### ‚úÖ Exit Option in Dropdown (Chosen)

**Why yes**:

- Contextual and discoverable
- Grouped with environment actions
- No toolbar clutter
- Only shows when needed

## Use Cases

### 1. Quick Environment Check

**Scenario**: Quickly check what's in Development, then return to main workflow

**Steps**:

1. Click environment dropdown
2. Click "Development" ‚Üí workflow loads
3. Review the nodes quickly
4. Click dropdown again
5. Click "Exit Environment View"
6. Back to main workflow

**Time**: ~10 seconds

### 2. Compare Then Return

**Scenario**: Compare Production with main workflow

**Steps**:

1. View Production environment
2. Note the differences
3. Exit environment view
4. Continue working on main workflow

### 3. Accidental Selection

**Scenario**: Accidentally clicked wrong environment

**Steps**:

1. Dropdown already open (since you just clicked)
2. See "Exit Environment View" at top
3. Click it immediately
4. Back to where you were

## Edge Cases

### Environment Already Selected

**Behavior**: Exit option appears immediately when opening dropdown
**Expected**: User can quickly exit without scrolling

### No Environment Selected

**Behavior**: Exit option is hidden
**Expected**: Clean UI, no unnecessary options

### Rapid Clicking

**Behavior**: Page reload ensures clean state regardless
**Expected**: No race conditions or state issues

### Browser Back Button

**Behavior**: Standard browser behavior (goes back in history)
**Note**: This is different from exiting environment view

## Future Enhancements

### üöß Smart State Restoration

Instead of page reload:

- Cache main workflow before loading environment
- Restore from cache when exiting
- Faster, no page reload needed
- Better UX

### üöß Confirmation Dialog

If user has unsaved changes:

- Show warning before exiting
- "You have unsaved changes. Exit anyway?"
- Prevent accidental data loss

### üöß Keyboard Shortcut

Add keyboard shortcut for power users:

- `Esc` key to exit environment view
- Quick and efficient
- Familiar pattern

### üöß Animation

Add smooth transition when exiting:

- Fade out current view
- Fade in main workflow
- Visual continuity
