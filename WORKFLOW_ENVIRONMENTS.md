## Overview

The Workflow Environments feature enables you to:

- Manage separate environments for your workflows (Dev, Staging, Prod)
- Deploy workflows between environments
- Promote workflows through the deployment pipeline
- Rollback to previous versions
- Compare differences between environments
- Track deployment history

## Features

### âœ… Multi-Environment Support

- **Development** (ðŸ”§) - For testing and experimentation
- **Staging** (ðŸ”¬) - For pre-production validation
- **Production** (ðŸš€) - For live deployments

### âœ… Deployment Operations

- **Create Environment** - Initialize a new environment from current workflow
- **Deploy** - Copy workflow from one environment to another
- **Promote** - Move workflow up the deployment chain (Dev â†’ Staging â†’ Prod)
- **Rollback** - Revert to a previous deployment version

### âœ… Environment Management

- **Version Control** - Automatic or manual version management
- **Status Tracking** - Active, Inactive, Draft, Archived states
- **Variable Isolation** - Environment-specific variables
- **Deployment History** - Complete audit trail

### âœ… Comparison & Analysis

- **Environment Comparison** - See differences between environments
  - Node changes (added, removed, modified)
  - Connection changes
  - Trigger changes
  - Setting changes
  - Variable changes

```

## API Endpoints

All endpoints require authentication.

### Get Environments

```http
GET /api/workflows/:workflowId/environments
```

### Deploy to Environment

```http
POST /api/workflows/:workflowId/environments/deploy

{
  "sourceEnvironment": "DEVELOPMENT",
  "targetEnvironment": "STAGING",
  "version": "1.1.0",
  "deploymentNote": "Feature: Added new nodes",
  "copyVariables": true,
  "activateAfterDeploy": false
}
```

### Promote Environment

```http
POST /api/workflows/:workflowId/environments/:environment/promote
```

### Rollback Environment

```http
POST /api/workflows/:workflowId/environments/:environment/rollback
```

### Compare Environments

```http
GET /api/workflows/:workflowId/environments/compare?source=DEVELOPMENT&target=STAGING
```

## Usage Guide

### 1. Create Your First Environment

```typescript
const { createEnvironment } = useEnvironmentStore();

await createEnvironment(workflowId, {
  environment: EnvironmentType.DEVELOPMENT,
  version: "1.0.0",
  deploymentNote: "Initial development environment",
});
```

### 2. Deploy to Staging

```typescript
const { deployToEnvironment } = useEnvironmentStore();

await deployToEnvironment(workflowId, {
  sourceEnvironment: EnvironmentType.DEVELOPMENT,
  targetEnvironment: EnvironmentType.STAGING,
  deploymentNote: "Ready for testing",
  copyVariables: true,
  activateAfterDeploy: false,
});
```

### 3. Promote to Production

```typescript
const { promoteEnvironment } = useEnvironmentStore();

await promoteEnvironment(workflowId, EnvironmentType.STAGING, {
  version: "2.0.0",
  deploymentNote: "Production release v2.0",
  activateAfterDeploy: true,
});
```

## Best Practices

### Environment Workflow

Follow this deployment pipeline:

```
Development â†’ Staging â†’ Production
    ðŸ”§          ðŸ”¬           ðŸš€
```

### Version Management

- Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Auto-increment for minor changes
- Manually specify for major releases

### Deployment Notes

Always include:

- What changed
- Why it changed
- Any breaking changes
- Migration steps if needed

### Security

- Production environments should be activated cautiously
- Limit who can promote to production
- Review deployment history regularly
- Use deployment notes for audit trail
