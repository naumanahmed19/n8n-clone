# CustomNode Component Refactoring

## Overview

The `CustomNode` component has been successfully refactored from a monolithic 600+ line component into smaller, more maintainable pieces following React best practices.

## Structure

### Before

- Single file: `CustomNode.tsx` (600+ lines)
- All logic, state management, and UI in one place
- Difficult to test and maintain

### After

```
frontend/src/components/workflow/
├── CustomNode.tsx (100 lines) - Main component
├── hooks/
│   ├── useNodeExecution.ts - Execution state management
│   └── useNodeActions.ts - Node actions & handlers
├── components/
│   ├── NodeHandles.tsx - Input/Output connection points
│   ├── NodeContent.tsx - Icon and status display
│   ├── NodeToolbarContent.tsx - Toolbar buttons
│   ├── NodeMetadata.tsx - Label and progress display
│   └── NodeContextMenu.tsx - Right-click menu
└── utils/
    └── nodeStyles.tsx - Styling logic & utilities
```

## Benefits

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**

- **Hooks**: Business logic and state management
- **Components**: Presentational UI components
- **Utils**: Pure functions for styling

### 2. **Improved Testability**

- Each hook can be tested independently
- Components can be tested with mock props
- Styling utilities are pure functions

### 3. **Better Code Reusability**

- `useNodeExecution` can be used by other components
- `useNodeActions` handlers can be shared
- Styling utilities can be used across the app

### 4. **Easier Maintenance**

- Smaller files are easier to understand
- Changes are localized to specific areas
- Reduced cognitive load for developers

### 5. **Enhanced Performance**

- Smaller components can be memoized individually
- Hooks prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Better tree-shaking opportunities

## Key Refactorings

### Custom Hooks

#### `useNodeExecution`

Manages all execution-related state and logic:

- Tracks execution status (running, success, error)
- Handles execution results from workflow store
- Provides execute and retry handlers
- Consolidates execution error handling

#### `useNodeActions`

Handles all node actions:

- Toggle disable/enable
- Open properties panel
- Duplicate node
- Delete node
- Handle output connector clicks

### UI Components

#### `NodeHandles`

Renders input and output connection points:

- Distributes multiple handles evenly
- Shows hover effects on outputs
- Displays plus icon for quick connections

#### `NodeContent`

Displays node icon and status:

- Shows node type icon
- Displays execution status indicator
- Shows disabled overlay when needed

#### `NodeToolbarContent`

Wraps toolbar buttons:

- Execute/retry button
- Disable/enable toggle
- Conditionally shows based on node type

#### `NodeMetadata`

Shows node information below the node:

- Node label
- Execution progress bar (when running)
- Execution time (when completed)

#### `NodeContextMenu`

Right-click context menu:

- Properties
- Execute
- Duplicate
- Delete

### Utility Functions

#### `nodeStyles.tsx`

Pure functions for styling logic:

- `getStatusIcon()` - Returns appropriate status icon
- `getNodeColor()` - Determines node color classes
- `getAnimationClasses()` - Returns animation classes

## Migration Guide

### For Developers

The refactored component maintains the same public API:

```tsx
<CustomNode data={nodeData} selected={isSelected} id={nodeId} />
```

No changes needed in parent components!

### Internal Changes

- State management moved to custom hooks
- JSX split into smaller components
- Styling logic extracted to utilities

## Performance Considerations

1. **Memoization Opportunities**

   - Individual components can be wrapped with `React.memo()`
   - Hooks can use `useMemo` and `useCallback` for expensive operations

2. **Bundle Size**

   - Better tree-shaking due to smaller modules
   - Easier to identify unused code

3. **Render Optimization**
   - Child components re-render only when their props change
   - Reduced prop drilling through composition

## Future Improvements

1. **Add Unit Tests**

   - Test hooks independently
   - Test components with React Testing Library
   - Test styling utilities as pure functions

2. **Add Storybook Stories**

   - Document each component visually
   - Test different states and variations
   - Provide usage examples

3. **Further Decomposition**

   - Consider extracting status icons to a separate component
   - Create a handle positioning utility
   - Add prop types documentation

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Add `React.memo()` to child components
   - Use `useCallback` for event handlers
   - Implement virtualization for many nodes

## Conclusion

This refactoring significantly improves the maintainability and testability of the `CustomNode` component while maintaining backward compatibility. The new structure follows React best practices and sets a good foundation for future enhancements.
