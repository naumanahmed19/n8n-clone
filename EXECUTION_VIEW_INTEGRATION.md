# Execution View Integration

## Overview
Integrated execution detail view directly into the workflow editor page, replacing the standalone execution page with a contextual view at `/workflows/:workflowId/executions/:executionId`.

## Changes Made

### 1. URL Structure Change
**Old Pattern:**
```
/executions/:executionId
```

**New Pattern:**
```
/workflows/:workflowId/executions/:executionId
```

This provides better context and keeps execution viewing within the workflow context.

### 2. WorkflowEditorPage.tsx Updates

#### Added Execution Detection
- Added `executionId` parameter extraction from URL
- Added execution state management with `useState<ExecutionDetails>`
- Added execution loading state

#### Added Execution Loading Logic
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (!executionId) {
    setExecutionMode(false)
    clearExecutionState()
    return
  }

  const loadExecutionData = async () => {
    // Load execution details
    const executionData = await executionService.getExecutionDetails(executionId)
    setExecution(executionData)
    
    // Set execution mode
    setExecutionMode(true, executionId)
    
    // Apply execution states to nodes
    executionData.nodeExecutions?.forEach((nodeExec) => {
      setNodeExecutionResult(nodeExec.nodeId, {
        nodeId: nodeExec.nodeId,
        status: mapStatus(nodeExec.status),
        data: nodeExec.outputData,
        error: nodeExec.error,
        // ... timing data
      })
    })
  }
}, [executionId])
```

#### Added Execution Banner
When viewing an execution, displays a blue banner with:
- Execution status badge (running/success/error)
- Execution timestamp
- Node count
- "Exit execution view" button to return to editor

#### Conditional UI Rendering
- **Execution Mode**: Shows execution banner, hides toolbar, passes `readOnly={true}` and `executionMode={true}` to WorkflowEditorWrapper
- **Editor Mode**: Shows toolbar, normal editing capabilities

### 3. App.tsx Routing Updates

#### Added Execution Route
```typescript
<Route
  path="/workflows/:id/executions/:executionId"
  element={
    <ProtectedRoute>
      <WorkflowEditorLayout />
    </ProtectedRoute>
  }
/>
```

#### Removed Standalone Route
Removed the old `/executions/:executionId` route and `ExecutionDetailPage` import.

### 4. ExecutionsList.tsx Updates

#### Updated Navigation
```typescript
const handleExecutionClick = (executionId: string) => {
  const execution = filteredExecutions.find(e => e.id === executionId)
  if (execution) {
    navigate(`/workflows/${execution.workflowId}/executions/${executionId}`)
  }
}
```

#### Updated Active Execution Detection
```typescript
const activeExecutionId = useMemo(() => {
  const pathMatch = location.pathname.match(/^\/workflows\/[^\/]+\/executions\/([^\/]+)$/)
  return pathMatch ? pathMatch[1] : null
}, [location.pathname])
```

## User Experience Flow

### Viewing Execution from Sidebar
1. User opens workflow editor
2. Opens executions sidebar
3. Clicks on an execution
4. **Result**: Same page, workflow canvas switches to execution view mode with:
   - Blue execution banner at top
   - Read-only workflow view
   - Node execution states visualized on nodes
   - No toolbar (can't edit)

### Exiting Execution View
1. User clicks "Exit execution view" button in banner
2. **Result**: Navigates to `/workflows/:workflowId`, returns to normal editor mode

### Benefits
- ✅ **Contextual**: Execution view stays within workflow context
- ✅ **No Page Reload**: Smooth transition between edit and execution view
- ✅ **Better UX**: Users don't lose their place in the workflow
- ✅ **URL Clarity**: URL structure shows hierarchy (workflow → execution)
- ✅ **Code Reuse**: Uses same WorkflowEditor component, just in different modes

## Architecture

```
WorkflowEditorPage
├─ Detects executionId from URL
├─ If executionId present:
│  ├─ Load execution data
│  ├─ Set execution mode
│  ├─ Apply node execution results
│  ├─ Show execution banner
│  └─ Render WorkflowEditor (readOnly=true, executionMode=true)
└─ If no executionId:
   ├─ Show toolbar
   └─ Render WorkflowEditor (normal editing mode)
```

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/pages/WorkflowEditorPage.tsx` - Main integration logic
- `frontend/src/App.tsx` - Routing updates
- `frontend/src/components/execution/ExecutionsList.tsx` - Navigation updates

## Files Removed/Deprecated
- Standalone `/executions/:executionId` route removed
- `ExecutionDetailPage` component no longer needed (can be removed)

## Next Steps
1. Test navigation from ExecutionsList to execution view
2. Test "Exit execution view" button
3. Test execution state visualization on nodes
4. Consider removing `ExecutionDetailPage.tsx` file (no longer used)
5. Update any documentation or tests that reference old URL pattern

## Implementation Notes
- The WorkflowEditor component already supported `readOnly` and `executionMode` props
- The workflow store already had execution state management methods
- Node execution visualization was already implemented in CustomNode
- This change primarily involved routing and conditional UI rendering
