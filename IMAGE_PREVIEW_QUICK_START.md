# 🎉 Image Preview Node - COMPLETE!

## ✅ Implementation Status: COMPLETE

The Image Preview Node is fully implemented and ready to use!

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Register the Node

```bash
cd backend
npm run nodes:register
```

Or manually restart your backend server - the node will auto-register.

### 2. Start Using It

1. Open your workflow editor
2. Look for "Image Preview" in the node palette (Transform category)
3. Drag it onto the canvas
4. Double-click to configure
5. Enter an image URL (e.g., `https://picsum.photos/400/300`)
6. Watch the magic happen! ✨

## 🌟 What You'll See

### 1. Live Preview in Config Dialog
As soon as you type a URL, you'll see:
- Real-time image preview
- Image dimensions (e.g., "400 × 300")
- Loading spinner while loading
- Success message with dimensions
- Error messages for invalid URLs
- "Open in new tab" button on hover

### 2. Image as Node Icon
On the workflow canvas:
- The node icon changes to show your image
- Updates automatically when you change the URL
- Shows loading state while image loads
- Falls back to default icon on error

### 3. Beautiful Output Display
After execution:
- Large, high-quality image preview
- Image metadata (type, size, format)
- Alt text display
- Hover overlay with "Open full size"
- Collapsible JSON output
