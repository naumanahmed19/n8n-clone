# Execution View Fix

## Problem
When navigating to `/workflows/:id/executions/:executionId`, the page was showing the regular workflow editor instead of the execution view mode.

## Root Cause
The issue was that we had **two different components**:

1. **WorkflowEditorLayout** - The original component used in App.tsx routing
   - Located at: `components/layouts/WorkflowEditorLayout.tsx`
   - Only extracts `id` parameter (workflow ID)
   - No execution logic

2. **WorkflowEditorPage** - The component we modified with execution logic
   - Located at: `pages/WorkflowEditorPage.tsx`
   - Extracts both `id` and `executionId` parameters
   - Has execution detection and read-only mode

The routes in `App.tsx` were pointing to `WorkflowEditorLayout`, so our execution logic in `WorkflowEditorPage` was never being executed!

## Solution

### Updated App.tsx Routing
Changed the workflow routes to use `WorkflowEditorPage` instead of `WorkflowEditorLayout`:

```typescript
// Before
<Route path="/workflows/:id/executions/:executionId" element={<WorkflowEditorLayout />} />
<Route path="/workflows/:id/*" element={<WorkflowEditorLayout />} />

// After  
<Route path="/workflows/:id/executions/:executionId" element={<WorkflowEditorPage />} />
<Route path="/workflows/:id/*" element={<WorkflowEditorPage />} />
```

Kept `WorkflowEditorLayout` for the landing page route:
```typescript
<Route path="/workflows" element={<WorkflowEditorLayout />} />
```

## URL Patterns Now Working

### Editor Mode
```
/workflows/:id
```
- Shows toolbar
- Editable workflow
- Normal workflow operations

### Execution View Mode
```
/workflows/:id/executions/:executionId
```
- Shows execution banner (blue)
- Read-only workflow
- Node execution states visible
- "Exit execution view" button

## Components Structure

```
App.tsx
├─ /workflows → WorkflowEditorLayout (landing page)
├─ /workflows/:id → WorkflowEditorPage (editor mode)
└─ /workflows/:id/executions/:executionId → WorkflowEditorPage (execution mode)
```

## WorkflowEditorPage Logic Flow

```typescript
const { id, executionId } = useParams()

if (executionId) {
  // EXECUTION MODE
  - Load execution data
  - Set execution mode in store
  - Apply node execution results
  - Show execution banner
  - Render WorkflowEditor with readOnly={true}
} else {
  // EDITOR MODE
  - Show toolbar
  - Render WorkflowEditor normally
}
```

## Testing Checklist

✅ Navigate to `/workflows/:id` → Should show editable workflow  
✅ Click execution in sidebar → Should navigate to `/workflows/:id/executions/:executionId`  
✅ Execution view should show:
   - Blue banner with execution info
   - Read-only workflow (can't drag nodes, can't connect, can't edit)
   - Node execution states (green for success, red for error)
   - "Exit execution view" button
✅ Click "Exit execution view" → Should return to `/workflows/:id` in edit mode  
✅ Console logs show correct values:
   - `executionId` present in execution mode
   - `readOnly: true` in execution mode
   - `isDisabled: true` in WorkflowCanvas

## Additional Fixes Applied

1. Added `TooltipProvider` wrapper to WorkflowEditorPage (was missing)
2. Added debug console logs for troubleshooting
3. Updated ExecutionsList navigation to use new URL pattern

## Files Modified

- `frontend/src/App.tsx` - Updated routing to use WorkflowEditorPage
- `frontend/src/pages/WorkflowEditorPage.tsx` - Added TooltipProvider, debug logs
- `frontend/src/components/workflow/WorkflowCanvas.tsx` - Added debug logs

## Notes

- `WorkflowEditorLayout` is still used for the `/workflows` landing page
- Could potentially consolidate both components in the future
- Debug console logs can be removed after testing
