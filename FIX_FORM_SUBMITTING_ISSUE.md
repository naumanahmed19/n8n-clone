# Fix: Form Shows "Submitting" During Unrelated Executions

## Problem
When executing a separate workflow path (e.g., Manual Trigger → Anthropic), the Form Generator node incorrectly showed "Submitting..." even though it wasn't part of the execution.

### Root Cause
The nodes were checking the global execution state:
```typescript
const isExecuting = executionState.status === 'running'
```

This meant ANY workflow execution would make ALL interactive nodes (Form Generator, Chat Interface) appear as if they were executing.

## Solution
Changed to use the execution context manager to check if the specific node is in the current execution path:

```typescript
const isExecuting = executionManager.isNodeExecutingInCurrent(id)
```

### Files Modified

1. **`frontend/src/components/workflow/nodes/FormGeneratorNode.tsx`**
   - Changed from global `executionState.status === 'running'`
   - To node-specific `executionManager.isNodeExecutingInCurrent(id)`
   - Removed unused `executionState` import

2. **`frontend/src/components/workflow/nodes/ChatInterfaceNode.tsx`**
   - Applied the same fix
   - Changed from global execution state check
   - To node-specific execution context check

## How It Works

The `ExecutionContextManager` tracks which nodes belong to each execution:
- When Manual Trigger executes → only nodes in that path show as executing
- When Form Generator executes → only nodes in that path show as executing
- Nodes in separate paths remain in idle state

### Before Fix
```
Manual Trigger (executing) → Anthropic (executing)
Form Generator (shows "Submitting" ❌) → OpenAI (idle)
```

### After Fix
```
Manual Trigger (executing) → Anthropic (executing)
Form Generator (idle ✅) → OpenAI (idle)
```

## Benefits

1. ✅ **Accurate UI State**: Only nodes actually executing show loading state
2. ✅ **Better UX**: Users can interact with unrelated nodes during execution
3. ✅ **Proper Isolation**: Each execution path is independent
4. ✅ **No Cross-Contamination**: Separate workflow paths don't affect each other

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Manual Trigger Execution
- Trigger Manual Trigger node
- Form Generator should remain interactive (not show "Submitting")
- Only Manual Trigger → Anthropic path shows executing

### Scenario 2: Form Generator Execution
- Submit form in Form Generator
- Manual Trigger should remain interactive
- Only Form Generator → OpenAI path shows executing

### Scenario 3: Concurrent Paths
- Both paths can be triggered independently
- Each shows correct execution state
- No interference between paths

## Related Changes
This fix complements the earlier refactoring of `executeNode` which improved execution context management and path tracking.
