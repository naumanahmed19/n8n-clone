## What are Workflow Environments?

Workflow Environments allow you to maintain **separate versions** of your workflow for different stages of development:

- **Development** üîß - For building and testing new features
- **Staging** üî¨ - For pre-production testing and validation
- **Production** üöÄ - For live, production workflows

### Key Benefits

‚úÖ **Safe Testing** - Test changes without affecting production  
‚úÖ **Version Control** - Track different versions of your workflow  
‚úÖ **Easy Rollback** - Revert to previous versions if needed  
‚úÖ **Deployment Pipeline** - Promote changes through environments  
‚úÖ **Environment Isolation** - Each environment has its own state

---

## Getting Started

### Accessing Environments

1. **Open a Workflow** in the editor
2. Look at the **toolbar** at the top
3. Find the **Environment Selector** dropdown (next to the breadcrumb)
4. Click it to see available environments

![Environment Selector Location](docs/images/environment-selector.png)

### Initial Setup

When you first open a workflow, you'll see:

- **"Select Environment"** button
- No environments created yet

---

## Creating Environments

### Create Your First Environment

1. **Click** the Environment Selector dropdown
2. Under **"Create New Environment"**, select:

   - **Development** - Start here for new workflows
   - **Staging** - For testing before production
   - **Production** - For live workflows

3. **Fill in the Dialog:**

   ```
   Initial Version: 1.0.0
   Note (optional): Initial development environment
   ```

4. **Click "Create Environment"**

### What Happens When You Create an Environment?

- Takes a **snapshot** of your current workflow
- Saves all:
  - Nodes and their configurations
  - Connections between nodes
  - Trigger settings
  - Workflow settings
  - Variables (optional)
- Creates a **versioned copy** you can manage independently

### Versioning

Use **semantic versioning** (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):

- `1.0.0` - Initial version
- `1.1.0` - New features added
- `1.0.1` - Bug fixes
- `2.0.0` - Major changes

---

## Managing Environments

### Switching Between Environments

1. Click the **Environment Selector**
2. Click on any environment to **switch to it**
3. The selector shows:
   - üîß **Environment icon**
   - **Environment name**
   - **Version number** (e.g., v1.0.0)
   - **Node count**
   - **Active status** (if the environment is running)

### Environment Status

Each environment has a status:

- **Draft** üìù - Created but not deployed
- **Active** ‚úÖ - Currently running
- **Inactive** ‚è∏Ô∏è - Stopped/paused
- **Archived** üì¶ - Old version kept for reference

### Activating/Deactivating Environments

**To Activate:**

1. Switch to the environment
2. Use the workflow's **activate toggle** in the toolbar
3. Or use the environment menu options

**To Deactivate:**

1. Switch to the environment
2. Turn off the workflow's **activate toggle**

---

## Deploying Between Environments

> **Note:** Deployment dialogs and menus are coming soon! For now, you can create and switch between environments. Use the API directly for deployments (see API Reference section).

### Currently Available

‚úÖ **Switch Between Environments**

- Select from dropdown
- View environment details
- See version and node count

### Coming Soon

üöß **Manual Deployment** (In Development)

- Deploy from one environment to another
- Copy settings and variables
- Auto-activate option

üöß **Environment Promotion** (Planned)

- One-click promotion through pipeline

### How to Deploy (Current Workaround)

For now, you can deploy using the API:

```bash
# Deploy from Development to Staging
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/workflows/YOUR_WORKFLOW_ID/environments/deploy \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "sourceEnvironment": "DEVELOPMENT",
    "targetEnvironment": "STAGING",
    "version": "1.1.0",
    "deploymentNote": "Deploying tested features",
    "copyVariables": true,
    "activateAfterDeploy": false
  }'
```

Or promote an environment:

```bash
# Promote Development to Staging
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/workflows/YOUR_WORKFLOW_ID/environments/DEVELOPMENT/promote \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "version": "1.1.0",
    "deploymentNote": "Promoting to staging",
    "activateAfterDeploy": false
  }'
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Development Workflow

```
1. Create Development Environment
   ‚Üì
2. Build and test your workflow
   ‚Üì
3. When ready, deploy to Staging
   ‚Üì
4. Test in Staging
   ‚Üì
5. Deploy to Production
```

### 2. Version Numbering

- **Development**: Can use any version for testing
- **Staging**: Use release candidates (e.g., 1.2.0-rc1)
- **Production**: Use stable versions only (e.g., 1.2.0)

### 3. Environment Variables

- Set **different credentials** for each environment
- Use **test APIs** in Development/Staging
- Use **production APIs** only in Production
- Never share production secrets in Development

### 4. Testing Strategy

**Development:**

- Test individual nodes
- Test connections
- Test with sample data
- Use debug mode

**Staging:**

- Test complete workflows
- Test with realistic data
- Test error handling
- Test integrations
- Performance testing

**Production:**

- Monitor executions
- Set up error alerts
- Regular backups
- Gradual rollout

### 5. Deployment Notes

Always include clear deployment notes:

```
Good ‚úÖ:
- "Added Slack notification for failed orders"
- "Fixed timeout issue in payment processing"
- "Updated API endpoint to v2"

Bad ‚ùå:
- "Updates"
- "Changes"
- "Fix"
```

**Solution:**

- Make sure you're logged in
- Verify you own the workflow
- Check if you're using the correct account

### Issue: Deployment failed

**Solution:**

1. Check deployment history for error details
2. Verify source environment is valid
3. Ensure you have permission
4. Try again with a different version number

### Issue: Can't see environments

**Solution:**

1. Refresh the page
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify backend is running
4. Clear browser cache

### Issue: Environment not loading

**Solution:**

1. Check if workflow ID is correct
2. Verify API is accessible
3. Check authentication token
4. Review browser console logs
