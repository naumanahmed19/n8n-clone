### 4. Design Improvements

#### Visual Consistency

- Colors use opacity-based backgrounds (`/10` for backgrounds, `/20` for hovers, `/30` for borders)

#### Accessibility

- Better contrast in both light and dark modes
- Semantic HTML with proper ARIA labels
- Focus states preserved from shadcn components
- Proper text colors for readability

#### User Experience

- Icons are more professional and consistent
- Smooth transitions between light and dark themes
- Clear visual hierarchy with proper opacity levels
- Enhanced hover states for interactive elements

- [ ] Test in dark mode - all colors visible and readable
- [ ] Verify icons render correctly in all sizes
- [ ] Check environment selector dropdown in both themes
- [ ] Test create environment dialog in both themes
- [ ] Test deployment dialog in both themes
- [ ] Verify success/error messages in both themes
- [ ] Check hover states on all interactive elements
- [ ] Test with different environment types (Dev/Staging/Prod)
- [ ] Verify empty states display correctly

## Benefits

1. **Professional Appearance**: Lucide icons look more polished than emojis
2. **Cross-platform Consistency**: Icons render identically across all platforms
3. **Dark Mode Support**: Proper contrast and readability in dark theme
