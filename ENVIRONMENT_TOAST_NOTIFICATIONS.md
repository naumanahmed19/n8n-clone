# Toast Notifications for Environment Operations

## Overview

Added success and error toast notifications to environment update and deployment operations to provide visual feedback to users, matching the behavior of the workflow save functionality.

## Problem

When updating or deploying environments, users didn't receive any visual confirmation that the operation succeeded. This was inconsistent with the save workflow functionality which shows success messages.

## Solution

Integrated the `useToast` hook into environment dialogs to display:

- ‚úÖ **Success toasts** when operations complete successfully
- ‚ùå **Error toasts** when operations fail

## Implementation

### UpdateEnvironmentDialog.tsx

**Added Import:**

```typescript
import { useToast } from "@/hooks/useToast";
```

**Added Hook:**

```typescript
const { showSuccess, showError } = useToast();
```

**Success Toast:**

```typescript
showSuccess(`${getEnvironmentLabel(environment)} updated successfully`, {
  message: version
    ? `Version ${version} has been deployed`
    : `New version has been deployed`,
  duration: 5000,
});
```

**Error Toast:**

```typescript
showError(`Failed to update ${getEnvironmentLabel(environment)}`, {
  message: errorMessage,
  duration: 8000,
});
```

### ManualDeploymentDialog.tsx

**Added Import:**

```typescript
import { useToast } from "@/hooks/useToast";
```

**Added Hook:**

```typescript
const { showSuccess, showError } = useToast();
```

**Success Toast:**

```typescript
showSuccess(`Deployed to ${getEnvironmentLabel(targetEnvironment)}`, {
  message: `Successfully deployed from ${getEnvironmentLabel(
    sourceEnvironment
  )}${version ? ` (v${version})` : ""}`,
  duration: 5000,
});
```

**Error Toast:**

```typescript
showError("Deployment failed", {
  message: errorMessage,
  duration: 8000,
});
```

## Toast Messages

### Update Environment

**Success:**

```
‚úì Development updated successfully
  Version 1.2.0 has been deployed
```

**Success (Auto-version):**

```
‚úì Staging updated successfully
  New version has been deployed
```

**Error:**

```
‚úó Failed to update Production
  Connection timeout after 30s
```

### Manual Deployment

**Success:**

```
‚úì Deployed to Staging
  Successfully deployed from Development (v1.2.0)
```

**Success (No version):**

```
‚úì Deployed to Production
  Successfully deployed from Staging
```

**Error:**

```
‚úó Deployment failed
  Source and target environments must be different
```

## Toast Duration

- **Success messages**: 5 seconds (5000ms)

  - Enough time to read and acknowledge
  - Auto-dismisses to avoid clutter

- **Error messages**: 8 seconds (8000ms)
  - Longer duration for users to read error details
  - More time to understand what went wrong

## User Experience

### Before

```
User: *clicks Update Development*
Dialog: *closes*
User: "Did it work? ü§î"
```

### After

```
User: *clicks Update Development*
Dialog: *closes*
Toast: "‚úì Development updated successfully" üéâ
User: "Perfect!"
```

## Consistency

Now all environment operations provide feedback:

| Operation          | Visual Feedback              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Save Workflow      | ‚úÖ Toast notification        |
| Update Environment | ‚úÖ Toast notification (NEW!) |
| Manual Deployment  | ‚úÖ Toast notification (NEW!) |
| Create Environment | ‚úÖ Dialog confirmation       |

## Benefits

### ‚úÖ User Confidence

- Clear confirmation that action succeeded
- No guessing if operation completed
- Professional, polished UX

### ‚úÖ Error Awareness

- Immediate feedback if something fails
- Error details displayed prominently
- Users know to try again or investigate

### ‚úÖ Consistency

- Matches save workflow behavior
- Predictable notification pattern
- Familiar to users

### ‚úÖ Non-Intrusive

- Auto-dismisses after set duration
- Doesn't block workflow
- Can be manually dismissed

## Toast Types

### Success Toast (Green)

- ‚úì Checkmark icon
- Green background
- Positive action confirmation
- Auto-dismiss after 5 seconds

### Error Toast (Red)

- ‚úó X or Alert icon
- Red background
- Error message + details
- Auto-dismiss after 8 seconds (longer)

## Edge Cases

### Multiple Operations

**Scenario**: User updates Development, then immediately deploys to Staging

**Behavior**:

- First toast shows "Development updated successfully"
- Second toast shows "Deployed to Staging"
- Toasts stack vertically (if system supports)

### Rapid Actions

**Scenario**: User rapidly clicks Update multiple times

**Behavior**:

- Only one request sent (button disabled during operation)
- Single toast shown on completion

### Dialog Still Open

**Scenario**: Error occurs, dialog stays open

**Behavior**:

- Error toast appears
- Error alert in dialog also shows
- User can fix issue and retry

## Testing Checklist

## Future Enhancements

```
‚úì Development updated successfully
  [View Environment] [Dismiss]
```

### üöß Progress Toasts

For long operations, show progress:

```
‚ü≥ Deploying to Production...
  Uploading workflow (45%)
```

### üöß Undo Actions

Allow undoing recent operations:

```

  [Undo] [Dismiss]
```

### üöß Toast History

View past notifications:

```

```
