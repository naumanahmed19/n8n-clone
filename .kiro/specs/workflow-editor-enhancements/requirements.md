# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical functionality gaps in the workflow editor's top bar interface. Users currently cannot save workflow titles, and the import/export workflow buttons are non-functional. Additionally, there may be issues with the execute functionality. This enhancement will provide a complete and functional workflow management experience in the editor.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a workflow creator, I want to save and edit the title of my current workflow, so that I can properly identify and organize my workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is working on a workflow THEN the system SHALL display an editable title field in the top bar
2. WHEN a user clicks on the title field THEN the system SHALL allow inline editing of the workflow title
3. WHEN a user saves the title THEN the system SHALL persist the title with the workflow data
4. WHEN a user loads a workflow THEN the system SHALL display the saved title in the top bar
5. IF no title is set THEN the system SHALL display a default placeholder like "Untitled Workflow"

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a workflow manager, I want to export my workflows to files, so that I can backup, share, or migrate my workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the export button THEN the system SHALL generate a downloadable workflow file
2. WHEN exporting THEN the system SHALL include all workflow data including title, nodes, connections, and configurations
3. WHEN exporting THEN the system SHALL use a standard file format (JSON or similar)
4. WHEN exporting THEN the system SHALL suggest a filename based on the workflow title
5. IF the export fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a workflow manager, I want to import workflows from files, so that I can restore, share, or migrate workflows into the editor.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the import button THEN the system SHALL open a file selection dialog
2. WHEN a user selects a valid workflow file THEN the system SHALL load the workflow into the editor
3. WHEN importing THEN the system SHALL restore all workflow data including title, nodes, connections, and configurations
4. WHEN importing THEN the system SHALL validate the file format before loading
5. IF the import fails due to invalid format THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message
6. IF the import would overwrite current work THEN the system SHALL prompt the user for confirmation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a workflow user, I want the execute functionality to work properly, so that I can run my workflows successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the execute button THEN the system SHALL validate the workflow before execution
2. WHEN executing THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback about the execution status
3. WHEN execution completes THEN the system SHALL display the results or output
4. IF execution fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with actionable information
5. WHEN executing THEN the system SHALL disable the execute button to prevent multiple simultaneous executions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a workflow editor user, I want all top bar buttons to have consistent visual feedback, so that I understand when actions are available or in progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN buttons are clickable THEN the system SHALL display them in an enabled state
2. WHEN buttons are not available THEN the system SHALL display them in a disabled state with appropriate styling
3. WHEN an action is in progress THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators or progress feedback
4. WHEN hovering over buttons THEN the system SHALL display helpful tooltips explaining their function
5. WHEN actions complete THEN the system SHALL provide success feedback to the user

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a workflow editor user, I want to access node properties through intuitive interactions, so that I can efficiently configure nodes without accidental property panel openings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user drags a node THEN the system SHALL NOT automatically open the property panel
2. WHEN a user double-clicks on a node THEN the system SHALL open the property panel for that node
3. WHEN a user right-clicks on a node THEN the system SHALL display a context menu with options including "Properties"
4. WHEN a user selects "Properties" from the context menu THEN the system SHALL open the property panel for that node
5. WHEN the property panel is open THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which node's properties are being displayed
6. WHEN a user clicks outside the property panel THEN the system SHALL close the property panel
7. WHEN dragging nodes THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth drag functionality without interference from property panel interactions
