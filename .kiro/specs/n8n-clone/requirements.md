# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a workflow automation platform similar to n8n - a visual workflow builder that allows users to connect different services and APIs through a drag-and-drop interface. The platform will enable users to create automated workflows by connecting various nodes representing different services, triggers, and actions without requiring extensive coding knowledge.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create automated workflows using a visual drag-and-drop interface, so that I can connect different services without writing code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the workflow editor THEN the system SHALL display a canvas area for building workflows
2. WHEN a user drags a node from the node palette THEN the system SHALL place the node on the canvas
3. WHEN a user connects two nodes THEN the system SHALL create a visual connection line between them
4. WHEN a user saves a workflow THEN the system SHALL persist the workflow configuration
5. IF a workflow contains invalid connections THEN the system SHALL display validation errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure individual nodes with specific settings and credentials, so that I can customize how each service integration works.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a node THEN the system SHALL open a configuration panel
2. WHEN a user enters node parameters THEN the system SHALL validate the input format
3. WHEN a user saves node configuration THEN the system SHALL store the settings securely
4. IF a node requires credentials THEN the system SHALL provide a secure credential input interface
5. WHEN a user tests a node configuration THEN the system SHALL execute a test call and display results

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to execute workflows manually or automatically based on triggers, so that I can automate repetitive tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user manually triggers a workflow THEN the system SHALL execute all connected nodes in sequence
2. WHEN a trigger condition is met THEN the system SHALL automatically start the workflow execution
3. WHEN a workflow is executing THEN the system SHALL display real-time execution status
4. IF a node fails during execution THEN the system SHALL handle the error and provide feedback
5. WHEN a workflow completes THEN the system SHALL log the execution results

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to monitor workflow executions and view execution history, so that I can troubleshoot issues and track automation performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the executions page THEN the system SHALL display a list of workflow runs
2. WHEN a user clicks on an execution THEN the system SHALL show detailed execution logs
3. WHEN an execution fails THEN the system SHALL highlight the failed node and error details
4. WHEN a user filters executions THEN the system SHALL display results matching the filter criteria
5. IF execution data exceeds retention limits THEN the system SHALL archive older executions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage and organize my workflows in a workspace, so that I can keep my automations structured and accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new workflow THEN the system SHALL add it to their workspace
2. WHEN a user searches for workflows THEN the system SHALL return matching results
3. WHEN a user duplicates a workflow THEN the system SHALL create an exact copy with a new name
4. WHEN a user deletes a workflow THEN the system SHALL remove it and all associated executions
5. IF a user shares a workflow THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate access controls

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to extend the platform with custom nodes, so that I can add integrations for services not included by default.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer creates a custom node THEN the system SHALL validate the node structure
2. WHEN a custom node is installed THEN the system SHALL add it to the node palette
3. WHEN a custom node is used in a workflow THEN the system SHALL execute it like built-in nodes
4. IF a custom node has dependencies THEN the system SHALL manage the installation process
5. WHEN a custom node is updated THEN the system SHALL handle version compatibility

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want a robust backend API that can handle workflow execution and data processing, so that the platform can scale and integrate with various services reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend requests workflow data THEN the backend SHALL provide RESTful API endpoints
2. WHEN a workflow needs to execute THEN the backend SHALL process nodes using a queue-based system
3. WHEN integrating with external APIs THEN the backend SHALL handle authentication and rate limiting
4. IF the system processes large data volumes THEN the backend SHALL implement efficient data streaming
5. WHEN storing workflow data THEN the backend SHALL use appropriate database schemas for performance
6. WHEN executing JavaScript code in nodes THEN the backend SHALL provide a secure sandbox environment
7. IF using AI/ML integrations THEN the backend SHALL support frameworks like LangChain for LLM workflows

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to manage user access and system settings, so that I can control platform usage and security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin creates a user account THEN the system SHALL set appropriate permissions
2. WHEN an admin configures system settings THEN the system SHALL apply changes globally
3. WHEN an admin views system metrics THEN the system SHALL display usage statistics
4. IF security policies are updated THEN the system SHALL enforce new requirements
5. WHEN an admin manages credentials THEN the system SHALL maintain encryption standards
