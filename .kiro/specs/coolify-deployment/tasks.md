# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Prepare Docker configurations for Coolify deployment




  - Optimize existing Dockerfiles for production deployment
  - Create production-specific docker-compose.yml configuration
  - Add health check endpoints and container health monitoring
  - Configure proper environment variable handling for Coolify




- [ ] 2. Set up Coolify project and service configuration

  - Create new project in Coolify dashboard
  - Configure Git repository connection for automatic deployments




  - Set up service definitions for frontend, backend, PostgreSQL, and Redis
  - Configure internal Docker networking between services




- [ ] 3. Configure environment variables and secrets management

  - Set up automated backup strategy for PostgreSQL


- [ ] 5. Configure domain, SSL, and networking

  - Set up custom domain configuration in Coolify
  - Configure automatic SSL certificate generation
  - Set up reverse proxy rules for frontend and API
  - Configure CORS settings for production domain

- [ ] 6. Deploy and validate the application

  - Trigger initial deployment through Coolify
  - Verify all services are running and healthy
  - Test database connectivity and Redis functionality
  - Validate frontend-backend API communication

- [ ] 7. Set up monitoring and logging

  - Configure application logging through Coolify
  - Set up health check monitoring for all services
