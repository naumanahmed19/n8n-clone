# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will transform the current workflow execution system from simulation-only to actual execution of nodes, starting with Manual Trigger and HTTP Request nodes. The system currently provides a complete workflow editor with node connections and execution flow visualization, but all node executions are simulated. Users need to see real HTTP responses, actual data transformations, and genuine execution results instead of mock data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a workflow developer, I want to execute HTTP Request nodes with real network calls, so that I can test actual API integrations and see real response data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workflow containing an HTTP Request node is executed THEN the system SHALL make actual HTTP requests to the specified URLs
2. WHEN an HTTP Request node executes THEN the system SHALL return the actual HTTP response data including status codes, headers, and body content
3. WHEN an HTTP Request fails due to network issues THEN the system SHALL capture and display the actual error message and status code
4. WHEN an HTTP Request node has invalid parameters THEN the system SHALL validate the URL format and HTTP method before execution
5. IF an HTTP Request takes longer than the configured timeout THEN the system SHALL cancel the request and report a timeout error

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a workflow developer, I want Manual Trigger nodes to initiate real workflow execution, so that I can start workflows on-demand and pass actual trigger data through the workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Manual Trigger node is activated THEN the system SHALL start actual execution of the connected workflow nodes
2. WHEN a Manual Trigger provides input data THEN the system SHALL pass this data to the next connected nodes in the workflow
3. WHEN a workflow starts from a Manual Trigger THEN the system SHALL track the execution progress through each connected node
4. IF a Manual Trigger has no connected nodes THEN the system SHALL complete the execution successfully with no further processing
5. WHEN multiple Manual Triggers exist in a workflow THEN each SHALL be capable of independent execution

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a workflow developer, I want to see real execution progress and results, so that I can monitor workflow performance and debug issues with actual data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workflow executes THEN the system SHALL display real-time progress updates showing which nodes are currently executing
2. WHEN each node completes execution THEN the system SHALL display the actual output data produced by that node
3. WHEN a node fails during execution THEN the system SHALL display the actual error message and stack trace
4. WHEN a workflow completes THEN the system SHALL show the final execution results with actual data from all nodes
5. IF execution is cancelled by the user THEN the system SHALL stop all running nodes and report the cancellation status

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a workflow developer, I want proper error handling during real execution, so that I can identify and resolve issues with my workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a node execution fails THEN the system SHALL capture the actual error details including message, type, and context
2. WHEN a network request fails THEN the system SHALL distinguish between different error types (timeout, DNS, HTTP status, etc.)
3. WHEN a node has invalid configuration THEN the system SHALL validate parameters before execution and provide specific error messages
4. IF a workflow contains circular dependencies THEN the system SHALL detect this before execution and prevent infinite loops
5. WHEN an execution error occurs THEN the system SHALL log the error details for debugging while showing user-friendly messages in the UI

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a workflow developer, I want execution results to persist, so that I can review past executions and their outcomes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workflow execution completes THEN the system SHALL store the execution results in the database
2. WHEN viewing execution history THEN the system SHALL display actual execution times, node outputs, and any errors that occurred
3. WHEN a node produces output data THEN the system SHALL store this data for later review and debugging
4. IF an execution fails THEN the system SHALL store the failure details including which node failed and why
5. WHEN execution data is stored THEN the system SHALL include timestamps, execution duration, and resource usage metrics

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a workflow developer, I want secure execution of nodes, so that my workflows cannot compromise system security or access unauthorized resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing HTTP requests THEN the system SHALL validate URLs to prevent access to internal network resources
2. WHEN processing user input THEN the system SHALL sanitize and validate all parameters to prevent injection attacks
3. WHEN a node executes THEN the system SHALL enforce resource limits including memory usage, execution time, and network requests
4. IF a node attempts to access restricted resources THEN the system SHALL block the access and report a security violation
5. WHEN storing execution data THEN the system SHALL ensure sensitive information like credentials is not logged or exposed
