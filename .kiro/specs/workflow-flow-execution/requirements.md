# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current workflow execution system has critical issues with flow execution logic. When a single node is executed, the system should automatically execute all connected downstream nodes in the proper sequence. Additionally, users need visual progress indicators to see which nodes are currently executing, and the system must support multiple independent trigger processes within the same workflow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a workflow developer, I want node execution to automatically cascade to connected nodes, so that executing any node triggers the complete downstream flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a node completes execution successfully THEN the system SHALL automatically execute all directly connected downstream nodes
2. WHEN multiple nodes connect to the same downstream node THEN the system SHALL wait for all upstream nodes to complete before executing the downstream node
3. WHEN a node execution fails THEN the system SHALL stop the cascade and not execute downstream nodes unless configured otherwise
4. WHEN a node has multiple output connections THEN the system SHALL execute all connected downstream nodes in parallel
5. IF a workflow contains parallel branches THEN the system SHALL execute each branch independently and merge results appropriately

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a workflow developer, I want visual progress indicators during execution, so that I can see which nodes are currently running, completed, or failed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a node starts executing THEN the system SHALL display a visual indicator showing the node is in progress
2. WHEN a node completes successfully THEN the system SHALL display a success indicator with execution time
3. WHEN a node fails THEN the system SHALL display an error indicator with failure details
4. WHEN nodes are waiting for upstream dependencies THEN the system SHALL display a waiting/queued indicator
5. WHEN execution is complete THEN the system SHALL show a summary of all node statuses and execution times

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a workflow developer, I want multiple triggers to work independently, so that I can have different entry points that execute separate parts of the workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workflow contains multiple trigger nodes THEN each trigger SHALL be executable independently
2. WHEN one trigger is executed THEN it SHALL only execute its connected downstream nodes, not affecting other trigger branches
3. WHEN multiple triggers are executed simultaneously THEN each SHALL run in parallel without interfering with each other
4. WHEN triggers share downstream nodes THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent access appropriately
5. IF a trigger has no connected nodes THEN it SHALL complete successfully without affecting other parts of the workflow

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a workflow developer, I want proper execution flow control, so that I can handle complex workflow patterns like loops, conditions, and merges.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workflow contains conditional nodes THEN the system SHALL execute only the appropriate branch based on the condition result
2. WHEN a workflow has merge nodes THEN the system SHALL wait for all input branches to complete before proceeding
3. WHEN a workflow contains loops THEN the system SHALL prevent infinite loops while allowing controlled iteration
4. WHEN execution encounters a dead-end node THEN the system SHALL complete that branch successfully
5. IF a workflow has circular dependencies THEN the system SHALL detect and prevent infinite execution loops

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a workflow developer, I want execution state management, so that I can track, pause, resume, and cancel running workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workflow is executing THEN the system SHALL maintain real-time state of all nodes in the execution
2. WHEN a user requests execution cancellation THEN the system SHALL stop all running nodes and mark the execution as cancelled
3. WHEN a node is taking too long THEN the system SHALL provide timeout handling and allow manual intervention
4. WHEN execution is paused THEN the system SHALL maintain state and allow resumption from the same point
5. IF the system restarts during execution THEN the system SHALL recover execution state and continue or fail gracefully

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a workflow developer, I want execution history and debugging, so that I can analyze workflow performance and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workflow executes THEN the system SHALL record the execution path taken through the nodes
2. WHEN nodes execute THEN the system SHALL log input data, output data, and execution time for each node
3. WHEN execution fails THEN the system SHALL record the failure point and provide detailed error information
4. WHEN viewing execution history THEN the system SHALL show the complete execution flow with timing and data
5. IF execution takes an unexpected path THEN the system SHALL provide debugging information to understand why
