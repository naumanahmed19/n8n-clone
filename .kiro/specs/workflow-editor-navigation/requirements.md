# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a critical navigation gap in the workflow editor where users cannot return to the home/dashboard view once they enter the workflow editor. Currently, users become trapped in the workflow editor interface with no clear path back to the main application navigation, creating a poor user experience and limiting workflow management capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a workflow editor user, I want a clear way to navigate back to the home/dashboard from the workflow editor, so that I can access other parts of the application without being trapped in the editor.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is in the workflow editor THEN the system SHALL display a prominent "Home" or "Back to Dashboard" navigation button
2. WHEN a user clicks the home navigation button THEN the system SHALL navigate back to the main dashboard/home view
3. WHEN navigating back to home THEN the system SHALL preserve any unsaved workflow changes by prompting the user
4. WHEN there are no unsaved changes THEN the system SHALL navigate immediately without prompts
5. IF there are unsaved changes THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation dialog with options to save, discard, or cancel

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a workflow editor user, I want breadcrumb navigation to understand my current location and navigate efficiently, so that I can maintain context awareness within the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is in the workflow editor THEN the system SHALL display breadcrumb navigation showing the path from home to current workflow
2. WHEN viewing breadcrumbs THEN the system SHALL show clickable links for each level (e.g., "Home > Workflows > [Workflow Name]")
3. WHEN a user clicks on any breadcrumb link THEN the system SHALL navigate to that level
4. WHEN navigating via breadcrumbs with unsaved changes THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation
5. WHEN the workflow has a title THEN the system SHALL display it in the breadcrumb, otherwise show "Untitled Workflow"

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a workflow editor user, I want keyboard shortcuts for navigation, so that I can quickly move between views without using the mouse.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user presses Ctrl+H (or Cmd+H on Mac) THEN the system SHALL navigate back to home
2. WHEN a user presses Escape THEN the system SHALL attempt to navigate back or close the current view
3. WHEN using keyboard shortcuts with unsaved changes THEN the system SHALL show the same confirmation prompts as mouse navigation
4. WHEN keyboard shortcuts are available THEN the system SHALL display them in tooltips or help documentation
5. WHEN keyboard shortcuts conflict with browser shortcuts THEN the system SHALL use alternative key combinations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a workflow editor user, I want visual indicators of my navigation state, so that I understand where I am in the application hierarchy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in the workflow editor THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate this is a sub-view of the main application
2. WHEN displaying navigation elements THEN the system SHALL use consistent styling with the rest of the application
3. WHEN hovering over navigation elements THEN the system SHALL provide helpful tooltips
4. WHEN the current view has unsaved changes THEN the system SHALL display visual indicators (e.g., asterisk, dot) in navigation elements
5. WHEN navigation is disabled due to loading states THEN the system SHALL show appropriate disabled states

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a workflow editor user, I want the navigation to work consistently across different entry points, so that I can always find my way back regardless of how I accessed the editor.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the workflow editor from the dashboard THEN the system SHALL provide navigation back to the dashboard
2. WHEN accessing the workflow editor from a direct URL THEN the system SHALL provide navigation to the appropriate parent view
3. WHEN accessing the workflow editor from search results THEN the system SHALL provide navigation back to search or home
4. WHEN the entry point is unclear THEN the system SHALL default to navigating to the main dashboard
5. WHEN using browser back/forward buttons THEN the system SHALL integrate properly with browser navigation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a workflow editor user, I want the navigation to handle workflow state appropriately, so that I don't lose work when navigating away.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating away with unsaved changes THEN the system SHALL offer to save the current workflow
2. WHEN auto-save is enabled THEN the system SHALL save changes automatically before navigation
3. WHEN save fails THEN the system SHALL prevent navigation and show error messages
4. WHEN the workflow is in an invalid state THEN the system SHALL warn the user before allowing navigation
5. WHEN returning to a workflow later THEN the system SHALL restore the previous state if auto-saved

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a workflow editor user, I want the navigation to be accessible and follow web standards, so that I can use assistive technologies and standard browser behaviors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL announce navigation options clearly
2. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL provide proper focus management
3. WHEN navigation elements are focused THEN the system SHALL show clear focus indicators
4. WHEN using high contrast mode THEN the system SHALL maintain navigation visibility
5. WHEN navigation occurs THEN the system SHALL update the browser URL appropriately for bookmarking and sharing
