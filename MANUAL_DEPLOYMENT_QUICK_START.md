## Common Workflows

### Standard Deployment Pipeline

```
Development ‚Üí Staging ‚Üí Production
```

1. **Dev to Staging**

   ```
   Source: Development
   Target: Staging
   Copy Settings: ‚úÖ
   Copy Variables: ‚úÖ
   Auto-Activate: ‚¨ú (test first)
   ```

2. **Staging to Production**
   ```
   Source: Staging
   Target: Production
   Copy Settings: ‚úÖ
   Copy Variables: ‚¨ú (keep prod vars)
   Auto-Activate: ‚¨ú (manual verification)
   ```

### Quick Testing

```
Development ‚Üí Development (copy to test changes)
```

```
Source: Development
Target: Development
Copy Settings: ‚úÖ
Copy Variables: ‚¨ú
Auto-Activate: ‚úÖ (immediate testing)
```

## Deployment Panel (Alternative UI)

### Where: Create a page at `/workflows/:id/environments`

```typescript
import { DeploymentPanel } from "@/components/environment";

function EnvironmentsPage() {
  const { workflowId } = useParams();

  return <DeploymentPanel workflowId={workflowId} />;
}
```

**Features:**

- Environment status cards
- Quick deploy buttons for common routes
- Last deployment information
- One-click deployment

## Options Explained

### Copy Settings

**When to enable:**

- Deploying new features
- Syncing configurations
- Initial environment setup

**When to disable:**

- Environment has custom settings
- Testing different configurations

### Copy Variables

**When to enable:**

- Development ‚Üí Staging
- Staging ‚Üí Production (if same config)
- Testing with same variables

**When to disable:**

- Production has different API keys
- Different database connections
- Environment-specific URLs

### Auto-Activate

**When to enable:**

- Development environment
- Staging for immediate testing
- You're confident in changes

**When to disable:**

- Production deployments
- Need to verify first
- Large changes requiring testing

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Add Deployment Notes

```
Good: "Fix: Updated webhook handler for new API version"
Bad: "Update"
```

### 2. Use Version Numbers for Releases

```
Good: "2.1.0" (major.minor.patch)
Bad: Leave empty for every deployment
```

### 3. Follow the Pipeline

```
‚úÖ Dev ‚Üí Staging ‚Üí Prod
‚ùå Dev ‚Üí Prod (unless emergency)
```

### 4. Test Before Production

```
1. Deploy to Staging
2. Test thoroughly
3. Then deploy to Production
```

### 5. Don't Copy Variables to Production

```
Staging ‚Üí Production:
Copy Settings: ‚úÖ
Copy Variables: ‚ùå (production has its own)
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot find source environment"

- Create the environment first using Environment Selector
- Click "+" next to environment type

### "Source and target must be different"

- Select different environments
- Cannot deploy environment to itself

### "Deployment failed"

- Check network connection
- Verify you have permissions
- Check deployment history for details

### Environment not showing in selector

- Create environment first
- Refresh the page
- Check workflow has environments enabled

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Currently none, but you can:

1. Click environment selector: `Alt + E`
2. Click deploy button: `Alt + D`
3. Press Enter to deploy (when dialog open)
