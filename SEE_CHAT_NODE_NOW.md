# Quick Start: See Your Chat Interface Node

## ✨ It's Ready! Here's How to See It:

### Option 1: Test in Existing Workflow

1. **Make sure both backend and frontend are running**:
```bash
# Backend should show: Server running on http://localhost:3001
# Frontend should show: Local: http://localhost:5173
```

2. **Open your browser** to the frontend URL

3. **Go to any workflow** (or create a new one)

4. **Click "Add Node"** or the **+** button

5. **Find "AI Chat"** in the node list
   - Look for the 💬 emoji icon
   - Should be in "Communication" or "AI" category

6. **Drag it onto the canvas**

7. **BOOM! 🎉** You'll see the chat interface!

---

### Option 2: Use the Visual Test Page

Create a test page to see all variations:

**File**: `frontend/src/App.tsx` or create a new route

```tsx
import { ChatInterfaceNodeVisualTest } from '@/components/workflow/nodes'

function TestPage() {
  return <ChatInterfaceNodeVisualTest />
}
```

This shows:
- Basic empty chat
- Chat with message history  
- Disabled state
- Selected state
- Full workflow integration

---

### Option 3: Use the Demo

**File**: Add to your routes or test in a page

```tsx
import { ChatInterfaceNodeDemo } from '@/components/workflow/nodes'

function DemoPage() {
  return <ChatInterfaceNodeDemo />
}
```

This shows a simple ReactFlow canvas with one chat node.

## What You Should See

### On the Canvas:
```
🔵 (Input Handle)  
     ╔════════════════════════════════╗
     ║ 💬 AI Chat     🌟 GPT-4       ║
     ╠════════════════════════════════╣
     ║                                ║
     ║   💬 No messages yet           ║
     ║   Start a conversation         ║
     ║   System: You are a helpful... ║
     ║                                ║
     ╠════════════════════════════════╣
     ║ [Type a message...] [Send 📤]  ║
     ╚════════════════════════════════╝
                                    🟢 (Output Handle)
```

### Try It:
1. Click in the input field
2. Type "Hello!"
3. Press Enter or click Send
4. Watch the message appear as a user bubble (blue, right-aligned)
5. See typing indicator (3 animated dots)
6. AI response appears (gray, left-aligned)

## Verification Checklist

✅ **Backend**:
- [ ] Backend running on port 3001
- [ ] Node registered (you saw "AI Chat (chat)" in terminal)
- [ ] Database has the node type

✅ **Frontend**:
- [ ] Frontend running on port 5173
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] WorkflowEditor.tsx imports ChatInterfaceNode
- [ ] workflowTransformers.ts uses 'chat' type

✅ **In Browser**:
- [ ] Can open workflow editor
- [ ] Can see "AI Chat" in node list
- [ ] Can drag node onto canvas
- [ ] Chat interface renders
- [ ] Can type in input field
- [ ] Can send messages
- [ ] Messages appear in chat area

---

## Quick Debug

### If chat node not appearing in node list:

```bash
# 1. Check backend has registered it
cd backend
npm run nodes:register
# Look for: "AI Chat (chat)" ✅

# 2. Restart backend
npm run dev

# 3. Restart frontend
cd ../frontend
npm run dev

# 4. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
```

### If it appears but looks wrong:

Check browser console (F12) for errors. Common issues:
- Missing component imports
- TypeScript errors
- CSS not loading

### If it's a regular node instead of chat interface:

The transformer might not be using the 'chat' type. Verify:
```typescript
// In workflowTransformers.ts
const reactFlowNodeType = node.type === 'chat' ? 'chat' : 'custom';
```

---

## Expected Behavior

### When Adding Node:
1. Appears in node palette as "AI Chat" with 💬 icon
2. Can be dragged onto canvas
3. Immediately shows chat interface (not a small node)
4. Is 380px wide (much wider than regular nodes)

### When Interacting:
1. Input field is clickable
2. Can type text
3. Enter key sends message
4. Send button works
5. Message appears in chat area
6. Typing indicator shows
7. AI response appears after 1 second

### When Connecting:
1. Left handle (blue) = Input
2. Right handle (green) = Output
3. Can connect to other nodes
4. Handles are visible and clickable

---

## Pro Tips

### 1. Configure the Backend Node First
Before adding to canvas, configure:
- Model: GPT-4
- System Prompt: "You are a coding assistant"
- This will show in the chat interface!

### 2. Use in a Workflow
```
Manual Trigger → AI Chat → JSON Node
```

The chat interface works great in the middle of workflows!

### 3. Multiple Chat Nodes
You can add multiple chat nodes to the same workflow.
Each one is independent with its own messages.

### 4. Test the Visual Test Suite
The `ChatInterfaceNodeVisualTest` component shows:
- 5 different configurations
- All states (empty, with history, disabled, selected, workflow)
- Feature checklist
- Easy to see what's working

---

## Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:

✅ Chat interface appears on canvas (380px wide)
✅ Has header with icon and model badge
✅ Has scrollable message area
✅ Has input field at bottom
✅ Can send messages and see them
✅ Typing indicator animates
✅ AI responses appear
