## üöÄ Deployment Plan

### Phase 1: Core System (Complete ‚úÖ)
1. ‚úÖ Implement core credentials
2. ‚úÖ Add registration system
3. ‚úÖ Create documentation
4. ‚úÖ Verify compilation

### Phase 2: Testing (Next)
1. [ ] Start server and verify registration
2. [ ] Test credential creation
3. [ ] Test credential usage
4. [ ] Test OAuth flow
5. [ ] Fix any issues found

### Phase 3: Migration (Optional)
1. [ ] Update Google Drive node
2. [ ] Update Google Sheets node
3. [ ] Test backward compatibility
4. [ ] Deploy to production

### Phase 4: Rollout (Future)
1. [ ] Announce new feature
2. [ ] Update user documentation
3. [ ] Provide migration guide for users
4. [ ] Monitor for issues
5. [ ] Collect feedback

## üêõ Known Issues / Limitations

### Current
- None identified (system is ready to test)

### Potential
- OAuth routes may need updates for new credential names
- Existing workflows with old credentials need backward compatibility
- Users may need guidance on migrating to new credentials

### Mitigations
- Backward compatibility maintained in node implementations
- Clear migration documentation provided
- Gradual rollout with grace period

## üìù Notes

### Design Decisions
1. **Why TypeScript for credentials?**
   - Type safety for credential definitions
   - Better IDE support
   - Consistent with core codebase

2. **Why separate files for each credential type?**
   - Easier to maintain
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Easy to add new types

3. **Why register on startup?**
   - Ensures credentials are always available
   - No manual registration needed
   - Fails fast if there are issues

### Best Practices Followed
- ‚úÖ Single Responsibility Principle
- ‚úÖ DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- ‚úÖ Open/Closed Principle (easy to extend)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive documentation
- ‚úÖ Type safety
- ‚úÖ Error handling
- ‚úÖ Security considerations
