# Mock Data Execution Confirmation

## Overview

When executing a single node that has pinned mock data, the system now shows a confirmation dialog to the user.

## Implementation Details

### Confirmation Dialog

- **Trigger**: When `executeNode` is called with `mode: "single"` on a node that has `mockDataPinned: true`
- **Message**: "This node has pinned mock data. Executing it will replace the mock data with the actual execution response.\n\nDo you want to proceed with execution?"
- **Options**:
  - **OK/Yes**: Proceeds with the actual node execution
  - **Cancel/No**: Cancels the execution and logs the cancellation

### User Experience Flow

1. **User Action**: User clicks "Execute Node" on a node with pinned mock data
2. **System Response**: Shows confirmation dialog
3. **User Decision**:
   - **Proceed**: Mock data will be replaced with actual execution results
   - **Cancel**: Execution is cancelled, mock data remains unchanged

### Code Changes

The confirmation logic is implemented in the `executeNode` method in `workflow.ts`:

```typescript
// Check if node has pinned mock data and show confirmation dialog
if (node.mockData && node.mockDataPinned && mode === "single") {
  const shouldProceed = window.confirm(
    `This node has pinned mock data. Executing it will replace the mock data with the actual execution response.\n\nDo you want to proceed with execution?`
  );

  if (!shouldProceed) {
    get().addExecutionLog({
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      level: "info",
      message: `Node execution cancelled by user: ${node.name} (has pinned mock data)`,
    });
    return;
  }
}
```

### Benefits

1. **Data Protection**: Prevents accidental loss of carefully crafted mock data
2. **User Awareness**: Makes users explicitly aware that execution will replace mock data
3. **Workflow Continuity**: Allows users to cancel execution and keep using mock data for testing
4. **Audit Trail**: Logs cancellation events for debugging and tracking purposes

### Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive tests that verify:

- Confirmation dialog is shown for nodes with pinned mock data
- Execution is cancelled when user chooses "Cancel"
- Execution proceeds when user chooses "OK"
- No dialog is shown for nodes without pinned mock data
- No dialog is shown during workflow execution (only single node execution)
